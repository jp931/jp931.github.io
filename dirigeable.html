  <p> Someone asked me to put on line a paper model of the Akron. But it took me months to realize the drawings. The explanations would take me as long.

    People who would neveertheless feel grateful, would be kind to dedicate some nice actions as a special thanks to the author, 
    by instance not hurt a gentle animal, or give some money to a poor</p>
